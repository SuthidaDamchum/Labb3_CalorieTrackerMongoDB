# Calorie Tracker App
This is a school project made to learn how to work with MongoDB using the MongoDB.Driver in a C# application.
I chose to build a Calorie Tracker because I already track my daily calories in Excel. Creating my own app felt useful and motivating, and it made the project more personal and practical.
The application connects to a local MongoDB instance. When it runs for the first time, it creates its own database and adds demo data if the database does not already exist.

## Learning Goals

This project focuses on learning and practicing:
* MongoDB
* MongoDB Compass
* MongoDB.Driver
* Database seeding
* CRUD operations
* Asynchronous database communication

## Application Features

The app consists of three main views:

1. Daily Log
* View current date and date history
* Set a weekly calorie goal (one goal per week)
* See a daily summary comparing goal vs actual calories
* View a list of foods eaten during the day
* Increase or decrease the amount of a food item
* Delete food items from the daily log

2. Food List
* View all available food items
* Full CRUD functionality 
* Add selected food items directly to today’s daily log

3. Weekly Summary
* View weekly history
* See weekly food intake
* Compare macro goals with actual results for the week

## Notes
This project helped me understand how a real application interacts with a NoSQL database and how to structure data for daily and weekly tracking. 
It also gave me hands-on experience building something I can actually use in everyday life.
